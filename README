= Render Caching

Cache render calls in Rails controllers.


== Install

First install the gem.

  gem install ryanb-render-caching --source=http://gems.github.com

Then specify it in your Rails config.

	config.gem 'ryanb-render-caching', :lib => 'render_caching', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'

Rails 2.1 or later required.


== Usage

This gem adds the render_with_cache method to all controllers. Call 
this inside of an action to cache the view.

	def show
	  @user = User.find(params[:id])
	  render_with_cache
	end

This will cache the full rendered contents into a key matching the URL 
path (similar to action caching). You can change this key by simply 
passing any parameter.

	def show
	  @user = User.find(params[:id])
	  render_with_cache @user.cache_key
	end

Cache key is a method supplied by Rails. This includes the updated_at 
time which will give you an auto-expiring cache when the user record is 
updated.

You can also supply a block to the render call which will only get 
executed if there is no cache. Here is a good place to do any custom 
render calls.

	def show
	  @user = User.find(params[:id])
	  render_with_cache @user.cache_key do
	    render :layout => false
	  end
	end
